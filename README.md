# Ansible playbook for building ethereum nodes

This is an ansible script which turns any suitably spec'ed linux target into either an execution/consensus geth node or a full validator node.

This just copies the steps published here https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/merge-goerli-prater.md. Thanks to remy - an excellent guide!

NB This is configured for goerli - using the flag in the geth.service file in this repo.

NB For validators, DONT FORGET to put your address in the lighthousevalidator.service file where marked. 

(This guide assumes you have ansible installed on a management host, are running the following steps from it, and have an adequately specified linux host with ssh server configured and ready to be the target for the build) 

# Instructions

1. Add the IP address or hostname of the host you want to build to your inventory file (default: /etc/ansible/hosts) under a new group named geth_node 

2. Run the following `git clone https://github.com/WilsonBillkia/ethereum-node/`

3. Download the latest Lighthouse executable from here https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases and save it as lighthouse_exe under the files directory. 

4. In the ethereum-node directory run `ansible-playbook geth_validator_build.yml`

The playbook should perform all the steps necessary to install and enable the geth, beacon and validator services. (For non-validator nodes just leave out any steps which reference the validator from the main playbook.)
